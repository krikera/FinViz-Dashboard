## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### TensorFlow/Transformers Import Errors
If you encounter TensorFlow-related errors when starting the application:
```bash
# Use minimal requirements to avoid TensorFlow dependencies
pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt
streamlit run main.py
```
The application will automatically fall back to basic NLP features using TextBlob.

#### SpaCy Model Missing
```bash
# Install SpaCy language model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install specific missing packages
pip install textblob nltk wordcloud
```

### Data and Usage Issues

#### CSV Upload Problems
- **Format Issues**: Ensure your CSV has columns: Date, Description, Deposits, Withdrawls, Balance
- **Date Format**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format or common date formats (MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY)
- **Encoding Issues**: Save your CSV in UTF-8 encoding
- **Special Characters**: Remove or escape special characters in descriptions

#### Performance Optimization
- **Large Datasets**: Use date range filters to process smaller chunks
- **Memory Issues**: Disable NLP features for very large datasets (>100k transactions)
- **Slow Loading**: Start with minimal requirements and enable NLP features gradually

#### NLP Features Not Working
- **Check Dependencies**: Verify advanced NLP libraries are installed
- **Fallback Mode**: Application will use basic text processing if advanced libraries unavailable
- **Error Messages**: Check the console for specific library loading errors

### Application Behavior

#### Features Automatically Disabled
The application includes intelligent fallback mechanisms:
- **Advanced NLP ‚Üí TextBlob**: When transformers/spacy unavailable
- **Semantic Search ‚Üí Keyword Search**: When sentence transformers unavailable  
- **Topic Modeling ‚Üí Basic Categorization**: When gensim unavailable
- **Word Clouds ‚Üí Text Analysis**: When wordcloud library unavailable

#### User Preferences Not Saving
- Check write permissions in the application directory
- Ensure `user_preferences.json` can be created/modified
- Restart the application if preferences appear corrupted

### Getting Help

#### Enable Debug Mode
```bash
streamlit run main.py --logger.level debug
```

#### Check Library Availability
The application displays which NLP libraries are available in the console output when starting.

#### Common Solutions
1. **Restart the application** - Fixes most temporary issues
2. **Clear browser cache** - Resolves Streamlit display issues  
3. **Update dependencies** - `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`
4. **Use minimal setup** - Start with `requirements_minimal.txt` and add features gradually
